# Hi! Welcome to my personal Readme

If you‚Äôve landed here, we probably work together or might end up working together! Use this README as a way to get to know me better: my personality, the way I work, and what makes me tick.

# My Personality

## Easygoing

I have a great sense of humor, and by default, I never take anything personally. Jokes (especially dad jokes) and memes are always welcome. Having lived in the UK for many years, I‚Äôve developed a tendency for self-deprecating humor and casual chitchat about the weather.

## Cheerful (Mmst days)
I‚Äôm a positive person and tend to cheer people up when times are tough. But even superheroes need a break! If I‚Äôm not in my usual good mood, give me a bit of time to recharge.

## Pragmatic (with some caveats)
I‚Äôm flexible and usually favor the least painful solution. However, if the proposed approach involves technical debt, data migrations we could avoid, or doing things twice, I‚Äôll invest the necessary time and energy to demonstrate why the ‚Äúright way‚Äù is better. And this might mean pushing back deadlines or revisiting tasks, but it‚Äôs always in the spirit of building better solutions.

## Feedback reception
I‚Äôm always striving to grow and improve, and feedback is crucial for that. If you notice something I could do differently, do better, or perhaps stop doing altogether, feel free to have an open discussion with me or drop me a DM.

## Participation style
In meetings, I‚Äôm not always the most vocal person. Please don‚Äôt mistake my quietness for disengagement. Depending on the day and how inspired I feel, I might contribute more or less. Sometimes, I lead discussions; other times, I take a backseat to listen. I also like adding thoughts asynchronously when the time feels right.

# How I work

## Meticulous
I like improving things, and for that, I need to understand what I‚Äôm doing. I prefer spending a bit of time upfront to dig into an issue‚Äîespecially if it‚Äôs outside my team or domain.
When asking for someone‚Äôs help or opinion, I typically provide context in a message beforehand so they can prepare before we jump on a call. I appreciate the same consideration when someone asks for my hand.

## Direct communication
Over the years, I‚Äôve become accustomed to working remotely, including asynchronously, so clear and concise text messages are crucial for me. If there‚Äôs no time for that, a quick call is better than poorly written messages. Additionally, sending non-urgent messages outside of work hours, especially when tools like Slack and Gmail have scheduling options, can be a bit disappointing. üòâ

## Whiteboard discussions
For complex solutions, potentially ‚Äúdirty‚Äù (code- or architecture-wise) ideas, or anything with long-lasting impact, I‚Äôm always up for brainstorming. Whether it‚Äôs a whiteboard, Excalidraw, FigJam, or another tool, let‚Äôs figure out the details, trade-offs, and the best path forward together.

## PR reviews
As I said above I am pragmatic, and I approach pull request reviews the same way. I‚Äôll clearly distinguish between blockers and opportunities for improvement. And please never take my comments to improve as a personal attack, we‚Äôre all in the same boat! If discussions get too lengthy, I strongly advocate for a call to pair review and resolve issues more efficiently.

## Pair Programming
I enjoy pair programming and have been doing it more frequently in recent years. If you need a second pair of eyes or even a rubber duck to talk through your ideas, don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out.

# Outside the software life
‚Äôm a DIY enthusiast. I refurbished a trader‚Äôs van into a cozy campervan (happy to share pictures if needed!) and have also built furniture, including a patio pergola.
I enjoy running, surfing, and trying out different types of sports.
